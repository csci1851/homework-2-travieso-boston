w# Homework 2: Gradient Boosting Methods

## Overview
In this homework, you will work with two datasets to explore gradient boosting and the underlying decision trees that power some of them. 

You will:

- Load and inspect biomedical datasets.
- Perform classification on two biological datasets: heart disease / cancer genomics. 
- Examine the performance and pitfalls of decision trees and GB methods.
- Learn principles of feature selection connecting back to HW1.

## Datasets

You will work with two datasets geared towards classification tasks:
1. Heart Disease Dataset (same as HW1)
- **Goal**: Predict presence/absence of heart disease.
- **Features**: Demographics, cholesterol, ECG results, etc.

2. Cancer Genomics Dataset
- **Goal**: Predict cancer type based on genomic signals.
- **Source**: UCI (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/401/gene+expression+cancer+rna+seq)
- **Features**: Genomic signals from hundreds of gene loci for different patient samples. If you look at the data (data/cancer_genomics.csv) you'll see that some columns seem to be missing. To reduce the size of the dataset, we have performed some initial feature selection based on variance.

## Installation

Install dependencies using pip:

1. **Clone** this repo (first time only):
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:brown-csci1851/stencil.git
   cd stencil/homework2
   ```
   If you already cloned it, update and move into the homework folder:
   ```bash
   cd stencil
   git pull
   cd homework2
   ```
2. Create virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv .hw2
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    source .hw2/bin/activate (Linux/MacOS) or .\.hw2\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

After creating and activating the virtual environment, select it as the Jupyter kernel in `src/playground.ipynb` to run the notebook using the same installed dependencies.

## Tasks

You will complete the TODOs in `model.py` and `playground.ipynb` to accomplish the following tasks:

- [ ] Load both datasets using your HW2DataLoader. 
- [ ] Prepare a training/evaluation pipeline to make testing different model configurations easier (scikit-learn has some nice functions for this)

### Gradient Boosting Models
- [ ] Train a gradient boosted on both datasets with and without standardization.
- [ ] Evaluate with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score using K-fold cross-validation (consider how some of these metrics change in the multi-class context).
- [ ] Experiment with trees of different depths and the size of your ensemble of models. Track evaluations of your model performance.
- [ ] Implement hyperparameter tuning and cross validation to ensure optimal model selection.
- [ ] Use your models to determine feature importance in both tasks.
- [ ] Take a model architecture from HW1 and perform feature selection/importance computations (hint: Lasso can be applied beyond regression).
- [ ] Determine whether your HW1 model performs better if you only provide it the top K features identified from your GB model (cancer genomics dataset only).

## Final Reflection

You will then write a **2–3 page PDF reflection** that includes **figures** and **interpretation** of your results. Your write-up should clearly reference the plots, tables, and metrics you generated (not just final numbers).

Your reflection must address the following:

### 1) Cancer Genomics Dataset
* What features are present in the cancer genomics dataset?
* What preprocessing steps did you apply (if any)?
* What initial observations did you make about the dataset (dimensionality, class balance, missingness, feature scale, etc.)?

### 2) Model Performance (Heart Disease + Cancer Genomics)
For **both datasets**, report and discuss model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

Include figures/tables of cross-validation results for each dataset, and briefly compare:
* Which dataset was easier/harder to classify?
* Which errors were most common (especially in the cancer dataset)?

### 3) Hyperparameter Tuning (Gradient Boosting)
Describe your hyperparameter tuning process and results:
* Which hyperparameters did you explore (e.g., `max_depth`, `n_estimators`, `learning_rate`, etc.)?
* What range of values did you test?
* Which configuration performed best on each dataset, and why do you think it worked well?
* Provide grid search table or plot.

### 4) Feature Importance and Interpretation
Discuss which features were most predictive:
* For gradient boosting: report the top features by importance (and include a figures/table/plot).
* Compare feature importance to HW1 feature selection (for example: using **Lasso** to identify important features). Do the two methods agree on what features matter most? Why or why not?

### 5) Comparison to HW1
Using **only the cancer genomics dataset**:
* Select the top-K features based on gradient boosting feature importance.
* Train an HW1 model (e.g., logistic regression or Lasso-based model) using (1) the full feature set and (2) the reduced top-K feature set. 
  - Did the reduced feature set improve or hurt performance?
  - Provide metrics and a short explanation of what you observed.

### 6) Discussion
Discuss limitations of your models and results, including model assumptions and generalizability, potential overfitting (especially with deeper trees or large ensembles), sensitivity to hyperparameters, and data quality issues.

## Expected Skills

By the end of this homework, you should be able to:

* Train and evaluate gradient boosting classifiers on biomedical datasets.
* Perform hyperparameter tuning and compare model configurations using cross-validation.
* Interpret feature importance and connect it to feature selection methods from HW1.
* Visualize and interpret model performance using appropriate metrics and plots.
